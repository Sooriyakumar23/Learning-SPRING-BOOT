Inside the JVM we have a special container called `Spring Container`
Spring Container will have different objects. The objects which are created here are called as 'Spring Beans'
'Singleton' & 'Prototype' are the scopes to create the Spring Beans
    @Component
    @Scope(value="prototype")
    Singleton :- Always once
    Prototype :- Only whenever getBean called [0 / 1 / 2 .....]
'SpringApplication.run' will create the Spring Container
@Autowired = uses Type & @Qualifier uses value
